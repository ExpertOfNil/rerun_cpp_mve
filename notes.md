# Minimally Viable Examples Using the Rerun SDK in C++

This is primarily used in communications with the Rerun team

## Current Example:

- SDK Version: 0.23.0
- Viewer Version: 0.23.0
- Description: The example workflow logs multiple images in rapid succession to
    a remote viewer.  This results in a few logs getting through but then ceases,
    as though the connection is dropped.
